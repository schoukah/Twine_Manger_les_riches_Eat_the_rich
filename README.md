# Too long, didn't read (TLDR)

An evolving interactive story about earth eating the rich. Kindly find
digressions, many thanks, and more or less technical details below.

# Wow that really took a while to put online ! 😮‍💨

Many people really dig writing code. Others
are very much into other kinds of writing, or "*graphies*" such as dance
(chore*graphy*), photo*graphy*, calli*graphy*, or into design,
poetry, painting, drawing, and so on —and they
have more or less time for programming. A lot of people combine
practices. Some of them transpose ideas from an art or a science to
another, —-from different kinds of writing-- making their way towards awesome sauce.

Nowadays though, it takes a special kind of stubborn to get going with
code beyond the basics and deal with the mayhem and *N*th circles hell of
🔥 💣 💥 👹 👿 👺 😈 💀 👻 🤯... The silver lining: more strength in
persistence along with higher tolerance to a
unique kind of discomfort.

This repository is a mess of different writings. Though so far, I'd say
I've give more attention to much less than 1% of this repository's
code: the tiny bits of code that that didn't work. The code that didn't compile.

## What took so long ?

I have a big problem with writing on a computer. I'm seldom happy with
where and how I write what --talk about writer's block! If you're
looking for endless ways to procrastinate, this graces the sundae with a
cherry that will magically appear on top every time you eat it 🍒.

In this case, I wanted to explore [Twine](https://twinery.org) with Visual
Studio Code as a text editor. I found the Twee 3 language tools
extension and had local fun until I decided I wanted to recreate this
[fantastic
setup](https://blog.lazerwalker.com/azure,/game/dev/2020/01/16/a-modern-developers-workflow-for-twine.html)
[Emilia Lazer-Walker](https://github.com/lazerwalker) detailed to publish
stories through
continuous integration.

I was soooo motivated. I didn't give up 🔥💪🔥! Not through the cryptic
error messages --especially the one whose best solution is
to just restart the code editor...and which takes in retrospect an
absurdly long time to figure out! 

And that explains the almost 8 hours over 2
days it took to make this work. 

### I had to update a few things

I went though both of Emilia Lazer-Walker's tutorials I found: [this one
on Dev.to](https://dev.to/lazerwalker/a-modern-developer-s-workflow-for-twine-4imp)
and the one I linked to above. I also found much wisdom in the comments
and am very grateful to Emilia Lazer-Walker as well as the commenters
and countless contributors to forums I've roamed into to look up errors.

With my gruff --but functional-- knowledge of node.js and npm, I
managed to update dependencies. I now have this [GitHub action workflow](https://github.com/schoukah/Twine_Manger_les_riches_Eat_the_rich/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)
which --as of the last commit date you'll find-- still works.

So here we are. Thanks again everyone \( ﾟヮﾟ)/
